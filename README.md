- Has there been a change in the average length of hospital stay due to COVID-19 complications?
- Has there been an increase in the proportion of deaths during hospitalization during the COVID-19 pandemic?
- Were respiratory system diseases more prevalent in 2020?
- Has there been an increase in the use of ICU beds post-2019?
